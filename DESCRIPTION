Description: Poor breast-cancer survival in low- and middle income countries (LMICs) can be attributed to late stage presentation and lack of access to systemic therapy.  This package contains a modeling system to project the outcomes of different early detection strategies in combination with systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in LMICs.
